# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

# https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/

# Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

# A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

# Example 1:
# Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
# Output: 3

# Example 2:
# Input: root = [1,null,2]
# Output: 2
