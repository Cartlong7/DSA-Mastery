# https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/

# Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

# Example 1:
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

# Example 2:
# Input: head = [1,2]
# Output: [2,1]

# Example 3:
# Input: head = []
# Output: []
