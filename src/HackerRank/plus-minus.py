# https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/three-month-preparation-kit-plus-minus/problem

# Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with 6 places after the decimal.

# Function Description

# plusMinus has the following parameter(s):

# int arr[n]: an array of integers

# Print the ratios of positive, negative and zero values in the array. Each value should be printed on a separate line with 6 digits after the decimal. The function should not return a value.

# Input Format
# The first line contains an integer, n, the size of the array.
# The second line contains n space-separated integers that describe arr[n].

# Output Format
# Print the following 3 lines, each to 6 decimals:

# -proportion of positive values
# -proportion of negative values
# -proportion of zeros

# Sample Input
# arr = [-4, 3, -9, 0, 4, 1]

# Sample Output
# 0.500000
# 0.333333
# 0.166667

# Explanation
# There are 3 positive numbers, 2 negative numbers, and 1 zero in the array.
# The proportions of occurrence are positive: 3/6 = 0.500000, negative: 3/6 = 0.500000 and zeros: 1/6 = 0.166667
