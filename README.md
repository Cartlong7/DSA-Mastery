Welcome to the `DSA-Mastery` project!

## Description

This project is dedicated to solving Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) problems daily, using TypeScript, Python, and soon Java. The main objective is to maintain public accountability by regularly committing solutions to this repository.

## Motivation

The motivation behind `DSA-Mastery` is to improve problem-solving skills in DSA and to encourage transparency in the learning process. By solving problems daily and sharing the solutions publicly, we aim to track progress and foster a collaborative learning environment.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your contributions.
4. Add the DSA problem to the challenges folder.
5. Solve a DSA problem using TypeScript, or Python.
6. Commit your solution to your branch.
7. Push your branch to your forked repository.
8. Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository.

Please ensure that your code follows the project's coding guidelines and includes appropriate documentation.

## Coding Guidelines
